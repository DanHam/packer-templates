Current build tools:

* Virtualbox Version 5.1.14 r112924

Note: Due to a bug in the version of VMware tools shipped with 8.5.3
you will need to download the latest version of the tools from
[here](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/details?downloadGroup=VMTOOLS1010&productId=491).
Once downloaded extract the tools and replace the existing VMware tools
iso's.
