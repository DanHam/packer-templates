# Boxes and Box Templates

Boxes produced by the Vagrant post-processor will appear here.

The box.json.template file can be used to create the required Vagrant metadata
for the box. Just copy it to something meaningful e.g. debian.json and
edit.

To add the box to Vagrant run `vagrant box add box.json`
